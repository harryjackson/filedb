This is less than beta software. I had a lot of duplicate photos etc that I
wanted to prune so I built this to do it. This is a write once script. Don't
use unless you're comfortable debugging C problems ie it worked for me and
served it's purpose. It likely will need tweaking by you to make it work in
your case.

INSTALL

    cd ./build/
    cmake ../


RUN 

    ./src/Debug/fdb file_db /
